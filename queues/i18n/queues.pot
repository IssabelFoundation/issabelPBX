msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible for a queue to NOT Answer a call and still enter callers to "
"the queue. The normal behavior is that all  allers are answered before "
"entering the queue. If the call is not answered, it is possible that some "
"early media delivery would still allow callers to hear recordings, MoH, etc. "
"but this can be inconsistent and vary. Because of the volatility of this "
"option, it is not displayed by default. If a queue is set to not answer, the "
"setting will be displayed for that queue regardless of this setting."
