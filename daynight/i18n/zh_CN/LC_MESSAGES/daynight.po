"By default, the Call Flow Control module will not hook Time Conditions "
"allowing one to associate a call flow toggle feauture code with a time "
"condition since time conditions have their own feature code as of version "
"2.9. If there is already an associaiton configured (on an upgraded system), "
"this will have no affect for the Time Conditions that are effected. Setting "
"this to true reverts the 2.8 and prior behavior by allowing for the use of a "
"call flow toggle to be associated with a time conditon. This can be useful "
"for two scenarios. First, to override a Time Condition without the automatic "
"resetting that occurs with the built in Time Condition overrides. The second "
"use is the ability to associate a single call flow toggle with multiple time "
"conditions thus creating a <b>master switch</b> that can be used to override "
"several possible call flows through different time conditions."

"If a selection is made, this timecondition will be associated with the "

"Feature code is set to override (Red/BLF on) then this time condition will "
"always go to its True destination if the chosen association is to 'Force "
"Time Condition True Destination' and it will always go to its False "

"Destination'. When the associated Call Flow Control Feature code is in its "
"Normal mode (Green/BLF off), then then this Time Condition will operate as "
"normal based on the current time. The Destinations that are part of any "
"Associated Call Flow Control Feature Code will have no affect on where a "
"call will go if passing through this time condition. The only thing that is "
"done when making an association is allowing the override state of a Call "
"Flow Toggle to force this time condition to always follow one of its two "
