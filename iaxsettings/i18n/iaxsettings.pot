"Asterisk: jitterbuffer. You can adjust several parameters relating to the "

msgid "Force Jitter Buffer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Asterisk: forcejitterbuffer. Forces the use of a jitterbuffer on the receive "
"side of an IAX channel. Normally the jitter buffer will not be used if "
"receiving a jittery channel but sending it off to another channel such as a "
"SIP channel to an endpoint, since there is typically a jitter buffer at the "
"far end. This will force the use of the jitter buffer before sending the "
"stream on. This is not typically desired as it adds additional latency into "
"the stream."

"<br /> Asterisk: resyncthreshold. When the jitterbuffer notices a "
"significant change in delay that continues over a few frames, it will "
"resync, assuming that the change in delay was caused by a timestamping mix-"

"measured jitter plus this resync threshold. Resyncing can be disabled by "
"setting this parameter to -1."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Asterisk: maxjitterinterps. The maximum number of interpolation frames the "

"frames to indicate silence, the jitterbuffer will assume silence has begun "
"after returning this many interpolations. This prevents interpolating "
