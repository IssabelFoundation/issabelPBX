"Queue Priority allows you to set a caller's priority in a queue. By default, "
"a caller's priority is set to 0. Setting a higher priority will put the "
"caller ahead of other callers already in a queue. The priority will apply to "
"any queue that this caller is eventually directed to. You would typically "
"set the destination to a queue, however that is not necessary. You might set "
"the destination of a priority customer DID to an IVR that is used by other "
"DIDs, for example, and any subsequent queue that is entered would be entered "
"with this priority"
