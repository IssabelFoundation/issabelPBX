"This module is for specific phones that are capable of Paging or Intercom. "
"This section is for configuring group paging, intercom is configured through "
"<strong>Feature Codes</strong>. Intercom must be enabled on a handset before "
"it will allow incoming calls. It is possible to restrict incoming intercom "
"calls to specific extensions only, or to allow intercom calls from all "
"extensions but explicitly deny from specific extensions.<br /><br />This "
"module should work with Aastra, Grandstream, Linksys/Sipura, Mitel, Polycom, "
"SNOM , and possibly other SIP phones (not ATAs). Any phone that is always "
"set to auto-answer should also work (such as the console extension if "
"configured)."
