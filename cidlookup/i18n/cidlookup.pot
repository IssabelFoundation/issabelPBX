"A Lookup Source let you specify a source for resolving numeric CallerIDs of "
"incoming calls, you can then link an Inbound route to a specific CID source. "
"This way you will have more detailed CDR reports with information taken "
"directly from your CRM. You can also install the phonebook module to have a "
"small number <-> name association. Pay attention, name lookup may slow down "
